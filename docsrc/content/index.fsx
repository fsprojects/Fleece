### Introduction

You can get an overview of the important part of the library by reading the following pages:

 - [ToJson and OfJson](./to-json-and-of-json.html) are the basic building blocks
 - [Codec](./codec.html) let's you combine both ToJson and OfJson in one declaration
 - [Combinators](./combinators.html) lets you have more control
